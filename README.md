# Introduction to Image Processing Course (IMA201)

## Course Overview
This repository is dedicated to the Introduction to Image Processing course (IMA201), covering the essentials of digital image processing and analysis. Topics include image acquisition chains, digital camera technology (optics, sampling, noise, radiometry, color), image restoration and enhancement (denoising, inverse problems, deconvolution, super-resolution, inpainting), and image analysis (differential operators, segmentation, local descriptors, texture, shape representation).
